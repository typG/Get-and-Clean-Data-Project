Variables
There are subject,measurement, and activity three categories. The measurement has 561 variables, and activity has 1 variables.
After I subset the original dataset based on the requirment, there are 68 varibles left.

Data
The original dataset consisted of test data and train data two parrts. I merged them together, and then subset based on the requirement.
Mean and Standard Deviation varibales are left in the measurment category due to the large number of varibales in the original dataset.

transformations  work   
No additional transformations I perfomed to the dataset except for above.
